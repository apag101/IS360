# [For your convenience], here is the provided code from Jared Lander's R for Everyone, 
# 6.7 Extract Data from Web Sites

install.packages("XML")
require(XML)
theURL <- "http://www.jaredlander.com/2012/02/another-kind-of-super-bowl-pool/"
bowlPool <- readHTMLTable(theURL, which = 1, header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
bowlPool

# 1. What type of data structure is bowlpool? 
#BolwPool is a data frame
str(bowlPool)
'data.frame':    10 obs. of  3 variables:
    $ V1: chr  "Participant 1" "Participant 2" "Participant 3" "Participant 4" ...
$ V2: chr  "Giant A" "Giant B" "Giant C" "Giant D" ...
$ V3: chr  "Patriot Q" "Patriot R" "Patriot S" "Patriot T" ...
# 2. Suppose instead you call readHTMLTable() with just the URL argument,
# against the provided URL, as shown below

theURL <- "http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp"
hvalues <- readHTMLTable(theURL)

# What is the type of variable returned in hvalues

#In this scenerio the variables returned are lists

# 3. Write R code that shows how many HTML tables are represented in hvalues
str(hvalues)
# 4. Modify the readHTMLTable code so that just the table with Number, 
# FirstName, LastName, # and Points is returned into a dataframe

readHTMLTable(theURL, which = 1)

# 5. Modify the returned data frame so only the Last Name and Points columns are shown.

# 6 Identify another interesting page on the web with HTML table values.  
# This may be somewhat tricky, because while
# HTML tables are great for web-page scrapers, many HTML designers now prefer 
# creating tables using other methods (such as <div> tags or .png files).

# how you view HTML page source in your web browser.
#I use IE 11. To view HTML page source i right click the page and select view source
