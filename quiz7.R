#Regular Expressions
#Regular expressions are best used for data that is using different formats. 
#For example, if you had 2 files where one file uses 3/1/14 as the date format 
#and the other file uses March 1, 2014 as date in one part of the file and 3-1-14
#another part of the file, it would be a good candidate for regular expresssion.
#In this scenerio we would use the search method of Regular Expressions to search
# for specific patterns in each file using wildcards.

#R Markdown
#R Markdown is an example of reproducible research because it is a tool that provides
#a way to use R code inside a HTML type presentation. It uses easy to learn syntaxt
#while allowing R code to be written in its native form. THis tools allows coders to 
#reproduce their code quickly and easily in a pdf, slideshow, html, word formats and more.

#Scatterplots and Correlation
#Correlation shows how 2 variables relate to one another. They can either have a negative
#correlation where one goes the opposite of the other or a positive correlation where they 
#both go the same direction or no correlation. Causation states that although to variables correlate
#doesn't necessarily mean one variablle would cause or effect the other.

#Variable Coding
#Variable coding helps categorise data with more descriptive column naming. Maybe you have have voters
#broken into two parties, Republicans and Democrats. If has location information, you can add another 
#demension such as state and add a more descriptive name by state (EG. NY, CT, NJ) to get a more detailed
#overview of which specific states lean more towards Democrat or Republican.
